UT Project#2
This is the accompanying readme file for "UT_BIT-Project#2_bikeshare.py". 
This python file can be executed from the python terminal prompt. Python 3.8 
and Microsoft Visual Studio Code was used to generate this .py file. Each function
generates a graph if the proper conditions are met. The graphs appear as separate 
windows and when the program is stopped, these windows will close. The windows during 
testing appear to stack on-top of each other thus the windows may need to be manually
moved over to see each figure.
